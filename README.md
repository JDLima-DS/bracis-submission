## BRACIS Submission - Names and Words Classification

### nomes_pessoais.csv
Corresponds to the personal names dataset used to train and evaluate the models.

### palavras_comuns.csv
Corresponds to the common words dataset used to train and evaluate the models.

### BERTimbau_Classification.ipynb
Notebook that contains the majority of the Experiment 1 (training of the SKLearn models, evaluation, statistic test)

### BERTimbau_Classification.ipynb
Notebook that contains the  training and testing of the BERTimbau model that was used to compare with the other four models trained in Experiment 1)

Obs: Depending on the machine used to run the python notebooks, it may be necessary to install some libraries such as: SKLearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Transformers, Torch, Pandas. These libraries can be easily installed using the PIP package manager. The python kernel used in the development of this application was at version 3.9.2, while PIP was at version 24.1. The BERTimbau model doesn't require, but it benefits a lot from the use of a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU).
